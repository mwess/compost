Reimplementation of the compost tool for Kolimo, but with better design.

Tagging already working. 
Next thing to do is check for training (single and kfcv) and write a better template option file.

Usage: `python compost.py PATH_TO_OPTIONS_FILE`

Default option file can be used as a template for now.
